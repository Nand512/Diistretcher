# Intro
The Diistretcher is an attempt to ensure letterboxing with my Wii input, as opposed to the monitor stretching the aspect ratio to fill the screen. This is accomplished by first scaling the original 4:3 image input from the Wii, then adding black bars to the side. This is done to ensure that nothing on the monitor's end will be done to attempt to stretch the image. My original idea was to modify the monitor's hardware/OSD but I think this will be better for me (and for others).
